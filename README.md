# Porting Lib
### A collection of utilities for porting mods from Forge to Fabric.

## Use
Porting Lib is split into modules. All modules are available on this maven:
```groovy
maven { url = "https://mvn.devos.one/releases/" }
```

You can depend on Porting Lib like this once you add the maven:
```groovy
modImplementation(include("io.github.fabricators_of_create.Porting-Lib:<module>:<version>"))
```

You can find the latest version on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/porting_lib/versions).
Just choose a version and use its version number.
