# Porting Lib
### A collection of utilities for porting mods from Forge to Fabric.

## Use
Porting Lib is split into modules. All modules are available on this maven:
```groovy
maven { url = "https://mvn.devos.one/snapshots/" }
```
```groovy
modImplementation(include("io.github.fabricators_of_create.Porting-Lib:<module>:<version>"))
```

The latest major and minor versions can be found in the `gradle.properties` file as `mod_version`.
The latest patch can be found from GitHub Actions as the build number.
